# Overview
Our aim is to develop an application for students who are looking for a lunch partner. The idea is similar to Tinder: Users can swipe through other profiles in order to find suitable lunchpartner, based mainly on interests, location, lunch time and especially what kind of lunch relationship a certain user is looking for. After a match, there is the possibility to get to know the lunchbuddy via chat and schedule a meeting.
